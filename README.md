# supercoolrename
A script I put together to rename media on my torrent server to make transferring to my NAS easier. Makes everything lowercase and replaces all non-alphanumeric characters (including spaces) with periods. PLeX compatible ðŸ˜Š. 

## Usage
Run the supercoolrename.py script in your media directory to rename everything within. Or change out the dir_path variable with your media path to run it from another location on your machine.
