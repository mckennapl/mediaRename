# mediaRename
A script I put together to rename media on my torrent server to make transferring to my NAS easier. Replaces all non-alphanumeric characters with periods. PLeX compatible ðŸ˜Š. 

## Usage
Run the script in your media directory to rename everything within. Or change out the dir_path variable with your media path to run it from another location on your machine.
